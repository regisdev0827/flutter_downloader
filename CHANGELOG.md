* **IMPORTANT**: the plugin must be initialized by `initialize()` at first
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `clickToOpenDownloadedFile` now renames to `openFileFromNotification` (to prevent confusing from `open` feature). Static property `maximumConcurrentTask` has been removed, this configuration now moves into `initialize()` method.
* full support SQLite on both Android and iOS side, the plugin now itself manages its states persistently and exposes `loadTasksWithRawQuery` api that helps developers to load tasks from SQLite database with customized conditions
* support localizing Android notification messages with `messages` parameter of `initialize()` method
* full support opening and previewing downloaded file with `open()` method
* (iOS integration) no need to override `application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:` manually anymore, the plugin now itself takes responsibility for handling it
